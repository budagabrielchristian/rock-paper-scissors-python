Game Description
Difficulty Levels
The game allows the player to choose from three different difficulty levels:

Easy - The computer intentionally loses every round. This is the easiest difficulty, where the player will always win.

Normal - The computer plays fairly, with a 50/50 chance of winning. The computer may randomly decide to let the player win, choose the same option for a draw, or beat the player.

Impossible - The computer almost always chooses the option that beats the player. It rarely draws or loses, making it extremely difficult to win in this mode.

Game Logic
Player's Choice:

The player selects their option (rock, paper, or scissors).
Computer's Choice:

The computer makes a choice based on the difficulty selected:
In Easy Mode, the computer picks the option that guarantees a win for the player.
In Normal Mode, the computer makes its choice randomly or lets the player win occasionally.
In Impossible Mode, the computer picks the option that beats the player's choice almost every time.
Determine Winner:

The game compares the player's option and the computer's option to determine the winner based on the following rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both the player and computer choose the same option, the result is a draw.
Results:

The game prints out the winner of the round and the computerâ€™s choice after a short pause for suspense.
Customization
Changing Options
You can modify the options for the game by adjusting the choices in the pick_option() and computer_option() functions. For example, you can add options like "Lizard" or "Spock" from the expanded version of the game.

Adjusting Difficulty Logic
To adjust how the computer chooses its options based on the difficulty level, modify the computer_option() function.
